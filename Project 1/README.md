Just a simple AngularJS app that uses the concept of directives

Angular Apps are declared with:
<html ng-app>

The ng-model tag allows data binding
- Data Binding essentially means that the <input> field will be simultaneously synced to the <h1> tag 
- This is done via the following format {{placeholder}}
